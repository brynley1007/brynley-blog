  <h1>ðŸ‘‹ About Brynley Grist-Yates</h1>

  <p>
    Iâ€™m <strong>Brynley Grist-Yates</strong>, born and raised in Blackpool. With a career grounding in resource-planning and workforce capacity modelling â€” including roles such as Senior Resource Planning Manager and Workforce Planning Manager â€” Iâ€™ve developed a deep fascination with patterns, projection and structure.  
  </p>

  <p>
    Off the clock, I channel that analytical mindset into storytelling and play. Whether Iâ€™m designing a campaign for <em>Dungeons & Dragons</em>, mapping diplomatic manoeuvres in <em>Star Trek: Ascendancy</em>, or crafting trivia challenges that spark curiosity, I love exploring the space where narrative, strategy and numbers collide.
  </p>

  <p>
    My blog blends these worlds: game-reviews and system breakdowns; analytical deep-dives into probabilities and player-behaviour; and reflections on how artificial intelligence and data-analysis can enrich storytelling and tabletop experiences.
  </p>

  <p>
    If youâ€™re a player, thinker or maker â€” welcome aboard. Letâ€™s roll the dice, chart the data and tell the stories that make it all worth playing.
